## GoVid Backend

`An App for the Mankind, of the Mankind and by the Mankind.`

There was an idea to put together all the functionalities, a healthcare app would ever need. This was not seeming possible by the series of actions being undertaken until now, because we haven't thought of creating a larger network by the help of pre-existing large network i.e. **AMAZON CARE** .

Here we have used **DJANGO** Framework (Python) as preferred backend to act as API source and other several functionalities which includes filter, search and bulk database.
