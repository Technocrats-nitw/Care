[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4IFknlfqIU) is the YouTube link for the demonstration of the application.

## TechStack : 
- Flutter and Android Studio 
- Tensorflow for Natural Language Processing 
- Django for backend and REST API for communication

#### Flutter

>Flutter is used in our project to create the UI of our Care Application. The flutter files are written using the programming language, Dart. Various interfaces have been coded for Patient, Doctor, Hospital and Amazon Healthcare Centre which have also been integrated with multiple functionalities.

#### Django for backend and REST API for communication

> Django is used in this project as backend framework which is responsible for handling GET & POST requests by client (Flutter here) and return responses in form of REST API.

#### Tensorflow for Natural Language Processing 

>A BERT(Bidirectional Encoder Representation) based model with GPT2 as head fine tuned with BioBert weights, being used for question answering on medical datasets and being used as chatbot.
