# Voctor 2.0 - Virtual Doctor
## < Hackon > with Amazon ;)

The idea of Voctor2.0 inherently comes from [Voctor 1.0](https://github.com/shivanshuman021/Voctor/tree/main/models/module3), which was our project in a previous hackathon. At that time we planned to train a T5 model to make a full fledged medical chatbot but ended up hardcoding a simple chatbot because of lack of gpu's and knowledge of training heavy models on colab. Through steady practice we explored NLP , and here in Hackon we got a chance to explore even broader aspect where we trained a BERT on medical Q/A dataset scraped from web and used GPT-2 as head of our model to generate answers to medical questions .
